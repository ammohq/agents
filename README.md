# Claude Code Subagents

A comprehensive collection of specialized AI agents for software development, each expertly crafted for specific technical domains. These agents follow the principle that specialized expertise delivers superior results compared to general-purpose approaches.

## Quick Start

When working with Claude Code, use the `Task` tool to delegate work to appropriate specialists:

```bash
# Example: Debug a React component issue
Use the Task tool with the frontend-specialist to investigate why the SearchComponent renders twice

# Example: Optimize a slow Django query
Use the Task tool with the django-specialist to fix the N+1 query problem in the UserViewSet

# Example: Set up CI/CD pipeline
Use the Task tool with the devops-engineer to create GitHub Actions workflow for deployment
```
