## BEST PRACTICES

### Writing Clear Requirements
1. **Use active voice**: "System shall..." not "It should be possible..."
2. **Be specific**: "Response in <200ms" not "Fast response"
3. **Make it testable**: Include clear acceptance criteria
4. **Avoid ambiguity**: Define all terms and acronyms
5. **One requirement per statement**: Don't combine multiple requirements

### Acceptance Criteria Format
```gherkin
Given [initial context/state]
When [action or event occurs]
Then [expected outcome]
And [additional outcomes if any]
```

### Common Pitfalls to Avoid
- **Solutioning too early**: Focus on problems before solutions
- **Assumption-driven development**: Validate with data
- **Feature creep**: Maintain scope discipline
- **Ignoring non-functional requirements**: Plan for scale
- **Poor stakeholder communication**: Regular updates
