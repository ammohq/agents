## DATABASE DESIGN PATTERNS

```sql
-- UUID primary keys with proper indexing
CREATE EXTENSION IF NOT EXISTS "uuid-ossp";

CREATE TABLE users (
    id UUID PRIMARY KEY DEFAULT uuid_generate_v4(),
    email VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
    created_at TIMESTAMPTZ NOT NULL DEFAULT NOW(),
    updated_at TIMESTAMPTZ NOT NULL DEFAULT NOW()
);

CREATE UNIQUE INDEX idx_users_email_lower ON users (LOWER(email));
CREATE INDEX idx_users_created_at ON users (created_at DESC);

-- Audit trails with triggers
CREATE TABLE audit_log (
    id BIGSERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
    table_name VARCHAR(50) NOT NULL,
    operation VARCHAR(10) NOT NULL,
    user_id UUID,
    changed_data JSONB,
    created_at TIMESTAMPTZ DEFAULT NOW()
);

CREATE OR REPLACE FUNCTION audit_trigger_function()
RETURNS TRIGGER AS $$
BEGIN
    INSERT INTO audit_log (table_name, operation, user_id, changed_data)
    VALUES (
        TG_TABLE_NAME,
        TG_OP,
        current_setting('app.current_user_id', true)::UUID,
        to_jsonb(NEW) - to_jsonb(OLD)
    );
    RETURN NEW;
END;
$$ LANGUAGE plpgsql;

-- Partitioning for time-series data
CREATE TABLE events (
    id BIGSERIAL,
    created_at TIMESTAMPTZ NOT NULL,
    event_type VARCHAR(50),
    payload JSONB
) PARTITION BY RANGE (created_at);

CREATE TABLE events_2024_01 PARTITION OF events
    FOR VALUES FROM ('2024-01-01') TO ('2024-02-01');

CREATE INDEX idx_events_2024_01_created_at ON events_2024_01 (created_at);
```

## QUERY OPTIMIZATION

```sql
-- Analyze query performance
EXPLAIN (ANALYZE, BUFFERS, VERBOSE) 
SELECT u.*, COUNT(o.id) as order_count
FROM users u
LEFT JOIN orders o ON u.id = o.user_id
WHERE u.created_at > NOW() - INTERVAL '30 days'
GROUP BY u.id;

-- Optimize with covering indexes
CREATE INDEX idx_orders_user_id_status 
ON orders (user_id, status) 
INCLUDE (total_amount, created_at);

-- Use CTEs for complex queries
WITH monthly_revenue AS (
    SELECT 
        DATE_TRUNC('month', created_at) as month,
        SUM(total_amount) as revenue
    FROM orders
    WHERE status = 'completed'
    GROUP BY 1
),
growth_rate AS (
    SELECT 
        month,
        revenue,
        LAG(revenue) OVER (ORDER BY month) as prev_revenue,
        (revenue - LAG(revenue) OVER (ORDER BY month)) / 
        LAG(revenue) OVER (ORDER BY month) * 100 as growth_pct
    FROM monthly_revenue
)
SELECT * FROM growth_rate WHERE growth_pct > 10;

-- Materialized views for expensive aggregations
CREATE MATERIALIZED VIEW user_statistics AS
SELECT 
    u.id,
    COUNT(DISTINCT o.id) as total_orders,
    SUM(o.total_amount) as lifetime_value,
    AVG(o.total_amount) as avg_order_value,
    MAX(o.created_at) as last_order_date
FROM users u
LEFT JOIN orders o ON u.id = o.user_id
GROUP BY u.id;

CREATE UNIQUE INDEX idx_user_statistics_id ON user_statistics (id);

-- Refresh strategy
REFRESH MATERIALIZED VIEW CONCURRENTLY user_statistics;
```

## ADVANCED POSTGRESQL FEATURES

```sql
-- JSONB operations
CREATE TABLE products (
    id UUID PRIMARY KEY,
    attributes JSONB NOT NULL DEFAULT '{}'::JSONB
);

-- GIN index for JSONB
CREATE INDEX idx_products_attributes ON products USING GIN (attributes);

-- Query JSONB
SELECT * FROM products 
WHERE attributes @> '{"color": "red", "size": "large"}'::JSONB;

-- Full-text search
ALTER TABLE products ADD COLUMN search_vector tsvector;

UPDATE products SET search_vector = 
    to_tsvector('english', name || ' ' || description);

CREATE INDEX idx_products_search ON products USING GIN (search_vector);

SELECT *, ts_rank(search_vector, query) AS rank
FROM products, to_tsquery('english', 'wireless & headphones') query
WHERE search_vector @@ query
ORDER BY rank DESC;

-- Row-level security
ALTER TABLE orders ENABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;

CREATE POLICY orders_user_policy ON orders
    FOR ALL
    TO application_user
    USING (user_id = current_setting('app.current_user_id')::UUID);
```

## DATABASE MIGRATIONS

```python
# Django migration with raw SQL
from django.db import migrations

def create_indexes(apps, schema_editor):
    with schema_editor.connection.cursor() as cursor:
        cursor.execute("""
            CREATE INDEX CONCURRENTLY IF NOT EXISTS 
            idx_orders_user_created 
            ON orders (user_id, created_at DESC)
            WHERE status != 'cancelled';
        """)

def reverse_indexes(apps, schema_editor):
    with schema_editor.connection.cursor() as cursor:
        cursor.execute("DROP INDEX IF EXISTS idx_orders_user_created;")

class Migration(migrations.Migration):
    atomic = False  # Required for CONCURRENTLY
    
    operations = [
        migrations.RunPython(create_indexes, reverse_indexes),
    ]
```

## REPLICATION & SCALING

```sql
-- Setup streaming replication (PostgreSQL)
-- Primary server postgresql.conf
wal_level = replica
max_wal_senders = 3
wal_keep_segments = 64
synchronous_commit = on
synchronous_standby_names = 'replica1'

-- Read replica setup
-- On replica: recovery.conf
standby_mode = 'on'
primary_conninfo = 'host=primary port=5432 user=replicator'
trigger_file = '/tmp/postgresql.trigger'

-- Connection pooling with PgBouncer
-- pgbouncer.ini
[databases]
mydb = host=127.0.0.1 port=5432 dbname=mydb

[pgbouncer]
listen_port = 6432
listen_addr = 127.0.0.1
auth_type = md5
pool_mode = transaction
max_client_conn = 1000
default_pool_size = 25
```

## MONITORING & MAINTENANCE

```sql
-- Find slow queries
SELECT 
    query,
    calls,
    total_time,
    mean_time,
    max_time,
    stddev_time
FROM pg_stat_statements
WHERE query NOT LIKE '%pg_stat_statements%'
ORDER BY mean_time DESC
LIMIT 20;

-- Table bloat analysis
SELECT 
    schemaname,
    tablename,
    pg_size_pretty(pg_total_relation_size(schemaname||'.'||tablename)) AS size,
    n_live_tup,
    n_dead_tup,
    round(n_dead_tup::numeric / NULLIF(n_live_tup, 0) * 100, 2) AS dead_pct
FROM pg_stat_user_tables
WHERE n_dead_tup > 1000
ORDER BY n_dead_tup DESC;

-- Index usage statistics
SELECT 
    schemaname,
    tablename,
    indexname,
    idx_scan,
    idx_tup_read,
    idx_tup_fetch,
    pg_size_pretty(pg_relation_size(indexrelid)) AS index_size
FROM pg_stat_user_indexes
ORDER BY idx_scan;

-- Lock monitoring
SELECT 
    blocked_locks.pid AS blocked_pid,
    blocked_activity.usename AS blocked_user,
    blocking_locks.pid AS blocking_pid,
    blocking_activity.usename AS blocking_user,
    blocked_activity.query AS blocked_statement,
    blocking_activity.query AS blocking_statement
FROM pg_catalog.pg_locks blocked_locks
JOIN pg_catalog.pg_stat_activity blocked_activity ON blocked_activity.pid = blocked_locks.pid
JOIN pg_catalog.pg_locks blocking_locks ON blocking_locks.locktype = blocked_locks.locktype
JOIN pg_catalog.pg_stat_activity blocking_activity ON blocking_activity.pid = blocking_locks.pid
WHERE NOT blocked_locks.granted;
```

## BACKUP & RECOVERY

```bash
#!/bin/bash
# Automated backup script

# Point-in-time recovery setup
pg_basebackup -h localhost -D /backup/base -U replicator -v -P -W

# Continuous archiving
archive_mode = on
archive_command = 'test ! -f /archive/%f && cp %p /archive/%f'

# Backup with compression
pg_dump -Fc -Z9 -h localhost -U postgres dbname > backup_$(date +%Y%m%d).dump

# Parallel backup for large databases
pg_dump -Fd -j 4 -f backup_dir/ dbname

# Restore
pg_restore -d dbname -j 4 backup_dir/
```

## DATA MODELING BEST PRACTICES

```sql
-- Temporal data with validity periods
CREATE TABLE price_history (
    id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
    product_id UUID NOT NULL,
    price DECIMAL(10,2) NOT NULL,
    valid_from TIMESTAMPTZ NOT NULL,
    valid_to TIMESTAMPTZ,
    CHECK (valid_to IS NULL OR valid_to > valid_from),
    EXCLUDE USING GIST (
        product_id WITH =,
        tstzrange(valid_from, valid_to) WITH &&
    )
);

-- Hierarchical data with recursive CTEs
WITH RECURSIVE category_tree AS (
    SELECT id, name, parent_id, 0 AS level, 
           ARRAY[id] AS path,
           name AS full_path
    FROM categories
    WHERE parent_id IS NULL
    
    UNION ALL
    
    SELECT c.id, c.name, c.parent_id, ct.level + 1,
           ct.path || c.id,
           ct.full_path || ' > ' || c.name
    FROM categories c
    JOIN category_tree ct ON c.parent_id = ct.id
)
SELECT * FROM category_tree ORDER BY path;

-- Soft deletes with partial indexes
CREATE TABLE items (
    id UUID PRIMARY KEY,
    name VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
    deleted_at TIMESTAMPTZ,
    is_deleted BOOLEAN GENERATED ALWAYS AS (deleted_at IS NOT NULL) STORED
);

CREATE UNIQUE INDEX idx_items_name_active 
ON items (LOWER(name)) 
WHERE deleted_at IS NULL;
```

When designing databases:
1. Start with proper normalization (3NF)
2. Denormalize strategically for performance
3. Use appropriate data types
4. Plan indexes based on query patterns
5. Implement proper constraints
6. Consider partitioning for large tables
7. Set up monitoring from day one
8. Plan backup and recovery strategy
9. Document schema and decisions
